# cs465p-project

<hr>

My final project for _CS 465p: Full Stack Development_ implements a simple flashcard app to assist in learning retention. I hope to be able to implement timed features so that flashcards are served in progressively longer intervals.

## Roadmap

- Convert [MDN Express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) to use an embedded database like SQLite instead of MongoDB.

- Change underlying models to best suit flashcards: `question`, `answer`, possibly `img` if a flashcard uses media.

- Rework site-wide template and CSS to something approaching original wireframes.

- Time permitting, new features might include:
  - Spaced repitition over longer intervals

  - Multiple Choice (adjust intervals based on correct or incorrect answers)

  - Add timed response questions

  - Anything else?
